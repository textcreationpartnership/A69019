         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:7305:7"/>
it ſerveth as a Ceremony: yet is not euery <hi>circumſtance</hi> a <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony</hi>; for, ſome Circumſtances are intrinſecall, and eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall to actions, and ſpecially making vp their nature. 2.

of God,</hi> leſt we haue, as S. <hi>Aug.</hi> ſpeakes, <hi>litem interminatum,</hi> an endleſſe controverſie, and ſeeme to aſſent or diſſent, when wee doe not.</p>
               <p>Any act internall or externall, done with intention to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour God thereby, is <hi>Cultus,</hi> worſhip of God. This done to that which is not God, as if it were God, is Idolatry againſt the firſt Commandement.</p>
               <p>When the honour is intended to the <hi>true obiect</hi> of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous worſhip, <hi>God,</hi> it is either <hi>mediately</hi> done to honour him, as in the duties of the ſecond Table, done in obedience to God; or more <hi>immediately,</hi> as in the duties of the firſt Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, done to God for his honour.</p>
               <p>The <hi>immediate</hi> worſhip of God is either Internall and principall, or externall and ſecondary.</p>
               <p>The <hi>internall</hi> conſiſteth in thoſe actings of the ſoule, which as it were naturally ariſe out of the true knowledge of God, and may bee reduced to <hi>Dependance</hi> on him, or <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage</hi> to him.</p>
               <p>The <hi>externall</hi> worſhip of God, is ſome outward action done in relation to the internall worſhip of God, which gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth ſubſiſtence to it; and ſo, to the honouring of God.</p>
               <p>This externall worſhip of God is either <hi>falſe,</hi> when it is framed meerely of the will of man, which is the thing for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden in the ſecond Commandement. Or, wholly accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the will of God, and then is <hi>true</hi> worſhip externall.</p>
               <p>The <hi>true externall</hi> worſhip of God is ſo, and ſo called <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione medij,</hi> or <hi>modi,</hi> in reſpect either of the <hi>meanes,</hi> or <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> of worſhip.</p>
               <p>In reſpect of the <hi>Meanes,</hi> all true worſhip of God is grounded either on Gods ſpeciall <hi>cammaund,</hi> to haue ſuch a thing done to him; and this is properly worſhip <hi>ex ſe,</hi> in and of it ſelfe: Or vpon Gods <hi>allowance</hi> onely, as touching the particular; and this is worſhip of God <hi>ratione medij,</hi> as it is a <hi>meanes</hi> of performing it: but not <hi>ex ſe,</hi> in and of it ſelfe, but <hi>per aliud,</hi> by vertue of ſome thing elſe. Of this ſort are the <hi>bodily geſtures,</hi> whereby as by outward ſignes wee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe to giue honour to God, whereof no <hi>particulars</hi> are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined in the Word.</p>

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>eneration</hi> differ not in the words, but onely by the intendments of men in vſing them; So <hi>Adoration of God</hi> is not differenced by any outward ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, which men vſe in token of honour from <hi>Civill Adoration</hi>; but either by the intention of the minde, or by the ordinance of man. Hence it is, that we find all the ſame words which import bowing of the knee, head, trunke, or proſtration on the face, familiarly given to ſuch reverence, as was thereby ſignified, as well in civill reſpects vnto men,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:7305:13"/>

Onely it is true, that ſuch Exhortations ſhew, that theſe were <hi>allowed</hi> of God, as they were vſed of godly men in his ſolemne Service, as expreſſions of joy in honouring of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And if that Scripture did intend an Injunction <hi>precep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue</hi> for <hi>Kneeling,</hi> yet no more then for <hi>bowing</hi> or <hi>falling flat,</hi>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:7305:14"/>
which we translate <hi>Worſhip.</hi> And if all theſe had been inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted geſtures of religious worſhip in the Temple, by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of that Exhortation, yet ſhould not this of <hi>Kneeling</hi> bee aſſigned to any act of religious ſervice more then other, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all thoſe three are put together conjunctiuely; <hi>Let vs Worſhip, Bow downe,</hi> and <hi>Kneele, &amp;c.</hi> which will manifeſtly proue, that they were all three indifferently vſed, and to bee vſed in any duties of worſhip, when they came before God, and meant to expreſſe their holy reverence of their God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Whence alſo it was, that (as <hi>Auguſt.</hi> obſerueth) the holy ſervants of God, publikely or privately, even in prayer it ſelfe, ſometimes <hi>ſtood,</hi> as did the Publican and Phariſies, who are blamed, not for <hi>ſtanding in Prayer,</hi> but for praying <hi>to be ſeene of men</hi>; Some <hi>ſate</hi> reverently before the Lord, as <hi>David,</hi> 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. though commonly they vſed to <hi>kneele,</hi> or <hi>bow</hi> themſelues downe.

And that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of men might not be ſnared by ſuch a neceſsity; nor occaſion giuen to ſuperſtition in matters of that Quality.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Neither are they well aduiſed which will needs haue <hi>Kneeling</hi> a geſture of <hi>religious</hi> Adoration, becauſe it is as they ſay, a ſigne of the greateſt reuerence or humbling of our ſelues; For if bowing the head and backe, be not grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, yet ſurely proſtration flat on the ground was: For as Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, Hee that toucheth the earth with his knees may goe lower, but ſo cannot hee, who toucheth it with his belly and face. And yet euen that geſture of proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration was vſed in giuing ciuill honour and reſpect to men, and not onely in Adoration to God, as hath beene ſaid.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:7305:14"/>5. Wherefore, as <hi>Calvin</hi> ſaith of <hi>Kneeling in prayer</hi> it ſelfe,<note place="margin">

               <p>And valeſſe wee ſhall graunt this, wee will bee driuen to ſay, that they did not Adore the Idoll that kiſſed the Calues, as did they that bowed the knee to <hi>Baal,</hi> nor they that lifted vp their eyes or hands to the Idols of the Mountaines, as well as the man that bowed and humbled himſelfe. Nor may wee any more ſay (as others haue, truely done) that <hi>Honorius</hi> the third was the firſt man that decreed <hi>Adorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> to the Sacrament it ſelfe, becauſe hee onely decreed that men ſhould reuerently bow themſelues to the Sacrament (not in receiuing it, but) when it (after the Conſecration) was eleuated by the Prieſt, or caried in the ſtreets. For this bowing (belike) was no geſture of <hi>Adoration,</hi> being vſually done in Ciuil reuerence to men. Only kneeling is Adoration.</p>
               <p>Yea, and hence will follow, that neither Pope,<note place="margin">Ordo Bon.</note> nor Maſſe-prieſt adoreth either Chriſt or the Sacrament in the act of receiuing, ſeeing the Pope, for ſtate, receiues it <hi>ſitting,</hi> &amp; the Maſſe-prieſt, by the <hi>Canon</hi> of the Maſſe, <hi>reuerenter ſtans ad Altare,</hi> reuerently ſtanding: Nay, that they which refuſe to receiue this Sacrament <hi>Kneeling,</hi> and will either <hi>ſtand,</hi> or <hi>ſit bare headed reuerently,</hi> yet they <hi>Adore</hi> not Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe or God in partaking the Sacrament, becauſe they vſe not that which is the proper geſture of <hi>Diuine Adoration,</hi> as they ſay, <hi>Kneeling.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. That Chriſt the ſonne of the liuing God is to be Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red both Internally and Externally, out of the Sacrament, and in the Sacrament, though not as conteined in the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or exiſtent, <hi>quoad corpus,</hi> bodily in the place where was the ſubſtance of Bread and Wine, as they ſpeake, hee is not a Chriſtian that doubteth, as <hi>Chamier</hi> well ſaith.

greater, if this geſture were onely a geſture of Adoration and none other which are not altogether equall with it for ſignification of higheſt reuerence. I adde, that by this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinity a man may be bare-headed or put off his hat, or make courteſie, or bend his body to the very Sacrament it ſelfe. without any reference of theſe ſignes of reuerence to God or Chriſt, and yet commit no idolatry, becauſe he doth not giue to them any Diuine reſpect, or Adoration, in as much as hee doth not <hi>Kneele</hi>; which were a ſtrange Paradox to bee taught.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Finally, I would haue men conſider, to what extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty (not ſo much ignorance, as) the deſire of victory hath caried theſe men, who taking <hi>Kneeling</hi> to bee an inſtituted Ordinance of God, annexed to ſome duties of his externall worſhip; doe complaine of our tranſlating of Gods owne or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances out of their proper place, by applying the vſe of <hi>Kneeling</hi> to the receipt of the Sacrament,<note place="margin">Courſe of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitie <hi>wrir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by a</hi> Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh-man <hi>vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named.</hi>

               <p>FRom the <hi>ſcope</hi> of the ſecond <hi>Commandement,</hi> and the publike <hi>Declaration</hi> of the Church, touching our Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies aforeſaid, this Argument may be framed:</p>
               <p>Arg. 2. <hi>All Ceremonies deuiſed by Man, or added to thoſe which God hath preſcribed, which are enioyned or vſed as meanes of minding vs of God, or helping vs in any part of his worſhip, or carying vs vnto him therein, are againſt the ſcope of the ſecond Commandement.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the</hi> Croſſe <hi>and other our Ceremonies are deviſed by men, or added and applyed by men, to thoſe Acts of worſhip which God hath preſcribed, as meanes to carry our thoughts vnto God, and the duties which wee tender to him, as the</hi> Declaration <hi>aforeſaid ſheweth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore theſe our Ceremonies as wee intend and vſe them, are againſt the ſcope of the ſecond Commandement.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Before <hi>Anſwer</hi> to this Argument, ſome <hi>Phraſes</hi> muſt be explained.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Added to thoſe which God hath preſcribed,</hi> is a doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſpeech. For it may ſignifie, addition of them as <hi>actes</hi> of worſhip euen as the other, and made <hi>parts</hi> of it, and not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>adiuncts</hi> to it. And in that meaning the <hi>Maior Propoſition</hi> is true, but the <hi>Aſſumption</hi> of our Ceremonies is falſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Againe, <hi>to bee meanes of carrying vs vp to God,</hi> or <hi>min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vs of God and our duties, &amp;c.</hi> are ambiguous phraſes, and may bee vnderſtood two wayes. 1. So as theſe meanes are vſed and vnderſtood as <hi>efficient</hi> and <hi>operatiue</hi> meanes, which worke by ſome vertue ſuppoſed to bee in them, as
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:7305:17"/>
the Papiſts fancie of their hallowed trinkets; or elſe, as meanes onely <hi>occaſionall,</hi> and <hi>obiectum à quo,</hi> objectiuely, which worketh at all nothing vpon vs, but preſents vnto the ſenſes an occaſion whereby the mind worketh vpon it ſelfe: as was the caſe of <hi>Ioſhuah</hi> his <hi>ſtone,</hi> ſet vnder an Oake in the Court of the Tabernacle. In the former Notion, the <hi>Maior</hi> is true, but the <hi>Minor</hi> falſe of our Ceremonies. In the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſenſe the <hi>Minor</hi> is moſt true of our Ceremonies, but the <hi>Maior</hi> which ſaith, that the vſe of ſuch meanes for an helpe to vs, is againſt the ſcope of the ſecond Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is apparantly falſe.</p>
               <p>For ſo farre is that commandement from bending againſt the deviſing and applying of ſuch helpes, as helpes to vs in the worſhip of God, that it doth rather require ſome ſuch. For,<note place="margin">In his <hi>Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſme</hi> on the 2. <hi>Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
                  </note> as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Cartwright</hi> ſaith, God in forbidding vs to bow downe to an Image or ſimilitude ſet vp by mans will, doth on the contrary require, that we bow our ſelues in worſhip of him, and vſe ſuch geſtures as agree to the worſhip in hand. Of which, ſeeing God himſelfe hath not given any particular preſcription, he hath left the deviſing or applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof (vnder generall rules aforeſaid) vnto men. And that ſuch a thing is lawfull and vſefull,<note place="margin">Exod. 13.16. Num. 15.38. Deut. 12.12.</note> God (who vtterly forbiddeth any reſemblance of himſelfe to be made by man) hath witneſſed by his owne Inſtitution of <hi>Phylacteries</hi> and <hi>Fringes,</hi> as monitorie remembrancers vnto man.</p>
               <p>Indeed, if God in that ſecond <hi>Commandement</hi> had ſimply forbidden all Images and Pictures to be made, as the <hi>Turkes</hi> vnderſtand that Law, then it would haue followed by Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie, that men might not deviſe or vſe any ſignificant Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonie at all. But when it is ſo, that he hath left free vnto man the picturing, engraving or expreſſion of any viſible creature, or hiſtory of things done, euen by God himſelfe, ſo farre as it can bee well ſhadowed out by ſuch workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, to teach and to mind vs of things profitable, as M. <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin. Juſtit.</hi> 1.11.12. ſheweth, and all our Divines accord; It will bee impoſſible to bring our ſignificant Ceremonies, intended not as an immediate meanes of worſhip vnto God, but immediately for an helpe and monitor to our
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:7305:17"/>
ſelues, vnder the laſh of that ſecond <hi>Commandement.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For 1. the object is altered. 2. The immediate vſe (when mans edification, and not the worſhipping of God immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately is ſought thereby) is cleane altered from ſuch vſe of the forbidden Images, as that <hi>Commandement</hi> forecloſeth.</p>
               <p>All our Divines (I thinke) are of one mind in this, that Ceremonies ought to be <hi>Exercitia pietatis,</hi> exerciſes of pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, which may ſerue to vs as expreſſions and incitements to dutie, as <hi>Calvin</hi> ſaith, <hi>which may edifie vnto the worſhip of God,</hi> as <hi>Paraeus</hi> ſpeakes. Yea,<note place="margin">Par. Com. in <hi>Rom. 14.</hi>
                  </note> euen thoſe which ſimply con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Decencie,</hi> ought to bee to <hi>Edification,</hi> as D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Ames</hi> ſaith, and thoſe of <hi>Decorum,</hi> ſuch as may ſhew and breed in vs a <hi>Veneration</hi> of Gods ordinances. So as ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant Ceremonies can not for ſuch an intention of Edifying men, bee blamed more then other Rites; vnleſſe it bee for ſpeaking as it were to the ſame end, which others doe, onely more plainely: as touching which I referre to the laſt Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and what I haue foreſaid about the ſecond Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

                  <hi>WHatſoeuer worſhip of God is not commanded, is not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of God. But</hi> Signing with the Croſſe <hi>and</hi> kneeling <hi>are worſhips of God not commanded. Ergo</hi> Croſſing <hi>and</hi> kneeling <hi>at the Sacrament are worſhips not accepted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I referre to the fourth Chapter for the Notions of worſhip, and then Anſwer thus, that if you vnderſtand worſhip which is <hi>properly</hi> ſo <hi>&amp; ex ſe,</hi> of and in it ſelfe ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted, the <hi>Maior</hi> is true, but the <hi>Minor</hi> falſe of theſe our Ceremonies: if you vnderſtand worſhip <hi>Improperly</hi> and <hi>per aliud,</hi> in reference to ſome other thing, the <hi>Minor</hi> is true of our Ceremonies, but then the <hi>Maior</hi> is vntrue.</p>
               <p>For, as neceſſary and proper worſhip is commanded, ſo there is a <hi>Circumſtantiall</hi> (as Maſter <hi>Cartwright</hi> calls it) or <hi>Reductiue</hi> worſhip, which is (as touching the particular) onely <hi>allowed.</hi> Now, though God doth more accept of the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:7305:18"/>
                  <hi>commanded</hi> worſhip, yet hee accepteth alſo that which hee <hi>alloweth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All preſcript formes of prayers to God, if they be found, are (as touching that externall forme) <hi>allowed</hi> worſhip only, but as touching their ſubſtance and internall forme, they are <hi>preſcribed</hi>; and in that reſpect, otherwiſe acceptable then onely for the outward forme which is not worſhip <hi>in ſe &amp; propter ſe,</hi> in it ſelfe and for it ſelfe as the other.</p>
               <p>The vſe of indifferent things ſaith <hi>Paraeus,</hi> doth pleaſe God, but <hi>non tanquam cultus, ſcil. in ſe:</hi> but not as worſhip, to wit, in and of it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>But to proue our Ceremonies to be <hi>worſhip</hi> (ſuppoſe <hi>in ſe &amp; ex ſe,</hi> in and of themſelues) at leaſt in our opinion and vſe of them, you object to this effect.</p>
               <p>Object. 4. <hi>Dedication is worſhip.</hi> Ergo, <hi>the Croſſe in our vſe of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I deny the Conſequence, which if you will proue from the thirtieth <hi>Canon,</hi> your Argument muſt bee thus formed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>By whatſoeuer meanes a thing is dedicated to the ſeruice of God or Chriſt, by that meanes God is worſhipped properly, and that meanes is made a proper worſhip of God</hi> in ſe, <hi>in it ſelf. But by the ſigne of the Croſſe the baptized Infant is dedicated to the ſeruice of him, that dyed for him, at the thirtieth</hi> Canon <hi>ſaith.</hi> Ergo, <hi>By that vſe of the Croſſe God is properly worſhipped, and the ſigning with the Croſſe is made of vs, a meanes of proper wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to God.</hi> To this Argument thus framed I further an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that the <hi>Maior</hi> is not found. For as <hi>Chamier</hi> ſaith of vowes to God, that euery vow to God is <hi>Formally</hi> wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, but not ſo <hi>Materially</hi> in the matter voluntarily vowed: So I ſay, dedication of any thing vnto God, is worſhip <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally,</hi> but not alwayes the <hi>matter</hi> dedicated <hi>Ex ſe,</hi> of it ſelfe, &amp; much leſſe the outward <hi>manner</hi> &amp; <hi>Solemnity</hi> of dedicating.</p>
               <p>I deny not but there may bee and is ſomething done in <hi>Dedication</hi> of a thing to God, which <hi>ratione praecepti in ſe,</hi> in reſpect of Precept and in it ſelfe is worſhip Eſſentiall: But there bee annexed thereto, other things, which pertaine not Eſſentially to that Dedication, but onely to the outward ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity.
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:7305:18"/>
And though thoſe <hi>Propter aliud,</hi> with reference to ſome other thing may be called worſhip, yet are they no proper worſhip, or meanes of it in themſelues.</p>
               <p>In the Dedication of the Temple there were Ingredients of both ſorts. The ſacrifices, prayers,<note place="margin">1 Kings 8. and 2 Chron. 6.</note> and prayſes of God with joy, were Eſſentiall meanes of the Dedication and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; but <hi>Salomons kneeling on a brazen Scaffold</hi> before the Altar, and <hi>ſtretching his hands</hi> towards heauen in prayer; the <hi>ſet number</hi> of his Peace-offerings the <hi>lengthning</hi> of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity vnto ſeuen dayes and 7. dayes, were meanes of the Dedication, not <hi>ad eſſe,</hi> to the being, but <hi>ad ornatum,</hi> to the ornament, partes of the ſolemnity and manner of worſhip, not worſhip <hi>ex ſe,</hi> but <hi>per aliud,</hi> in reference onely to ſome thing elſe, as they ſerued to expreſſe and further their holy rejoycing and thankefulneſſe.</p>
               <p>The like may be ſeene in <hi>Nehemiahs Dedication</hi> of the <hi>holy City,</hi> which was dedicated with prayſes to God,<note place="margin">Neh. 12.27, &amp;c.</note> offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings and prayers <hi>Really,</hi> but by a <hi>Perambulation</hi> about the wals and other ſolemnities there mentioned, <hi>Complemental<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> and in Ceremony. The former reallities were Eſſentiall meanes of the Dedication, the other only Acceſſory Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies adjoyned to the reall things, and no meanes of worſhip in themſelues, but <hi>per aliud,</hi> by way of reference and reduction.</p>
               <p>The Iewes did <hi>Dedicate</hi> their owne houſes with pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, hymmes, feaſtings and other Solemnities, ſaith M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Aine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſworth,</hi> on <hi>Deut.</hi> 20.5.</p>
               <p>If it ſeeme hard, That the <hi>Dedication</hi> is by the <hi>Canon</hi> refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to that vſe of the <hi>Croſſe.</hi> I anſwer, that the Canon doth not referre the Dedication to the Croſſe <hi>ſimply,</hi> as though that were the ſole or principall meanes; but onely, to that as a <hi>Ceremony.</hi> For thus goe the words. <hi>Eſteeming it a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Ceremony and honourable badge whereby the Infant is dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, &amp;c.</hi> And if I ſhould ſay that <hi>Nehemiah dedicated</hi> the <hi>walls</hi> and <hi>Citie of Ieruſalem,</hi> by going about the walls there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in two <hi>diuided companies,</hi> you could not gaineſay me, nor would miſtake the matter. For it is vſuall to aſcribe a thing done not alone the principall Agent, but to any Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

yea ſometimes to <hi>occaſions</hi> which worke not, or to <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuncts</hi> as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Cartwright</hi> well obſerueth in his Anſwer to the <hi>Remiſts</hi> vpon thoſe words of 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17. where it is ſaid that our <hi>light affliction worketh for vs a far more exceeding and eternall waight of glory</hi>; [<hi>Worketh</hi>] yea and it is an vſual kind of ſpeech to ſay, a thing is done by ſuch a means as worketh not at all to the doing, but only declareth what is done, or to be done.

                  </gap>, that they vſe it only as the Fathers in their beſt vſe, as a <hi>Ceremony</hi> and <hi>Badge.</hi> All which muſt bee ouerthrowne, if <hi>Dedication</hi> bee other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe aſcribed to the <hi>Croſſe,</hi> then as vnto a Ceremony, which ſignifieth the vſe of the Dedication it ſelfe (which is <hi>Really</hi> made by Baptiſme) which is, <hi>to profeſſe the faith of Chriſt crucified, &amp;c.</hi> And that they ſo meant, and no otherwiſe, my poore ſelfe, and others who haue ſtumbled at the Phraſe, might haue aſſured our ſelues out of the body and words of the <hi>Canon,</hi> and the reference of their meaning to the Booke of <hi>Common prayer,</hi> which expreſly ſheweth that this Ceremony is vſed only in <hi>token, &amp;c.</hi> And in ſooth (had not the Popiſh abuſe and Superſtitions about the <hi>Croſſe,</hi> made vs iealous of all vſe of it) who would not haue thought this a decent Ceremony at the adminiſtration of Baptiſme, to <hi>reminde</hi> all the congregation of their <hi>Chriſtian profeſſion,</hi> and <hi>warfare</hi> to which the Sacrament it ſelfe doth oblige them?</p>

               <p>For as that learned Author of the Treatiſe called <hi>Diale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticon Euchariſtia,</hi> printed at <hi>Geneva,</hi> and ſet out with the ſecond Tome of <hi>Beza</hi> his Works, in his life time, ſaith, The <hi>Bread</hi> is to vs the Body of Chriſt when we <hi>adore</hi> and <hi>receiue</hi> it, not as they doe in Poperie at the <hi>Elevation,</hi> when they <hi>onely looke on,</hi> or <hi>Circumgeſtation,</hi> when it is carried in the ſtreets, and they that <hi>Adore,</hi> receiue nothing.

                  <hi>that they adore Chriſt in the Sacrament,</hi> ſaith, <hi>Si in Coena, &amp;c.</hi> If this were done in the Supper, I would ſay, <hi>Eam demum Adorationem eſſe legitima<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, quae non in ſigno reſidet, ſed ad Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtum in coelo ſedentem refertur,</hi> that were yet a lawfull adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which reſteth not in the outward ſigne, but is referred to Chriſt himſelfe ſitting in heauen. And hee giveth, after, this reaſon, that they haue no promiſe of Chriſts preſence in the Sacrament, not as <hi>ſignatum in ſigno,</hi> as the thing ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in the ſigne, when it is conſecrated to bee <hi>honoured</hi> and <hi>carried about</hi> as a pompous ſpectacle, and <hi>invocated</hi>; but when it is <hi>received.</hi> For our Lord that ſaid, <hi>This is my body,</hi> ſayd, <hi>Take, eat, this is my body.</hi> The Sacraments conſiſt in their <hi>vſe,</hi> and are not Sacraments out of their vſe.

hands, no nor ſimply to the benefits received of, by, and with Chriſt, as a ſigne of our partaking them, but onely to our <hi>humble and gratefull acknowledgement of thoſe benefits received from Chriſt,</hi> as the <hi>Declaration</hi> ſheweth. So that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe <hi>humble and gratefull acknowledgement of thoſe benefits</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree not to that very hint of time, when, by vertue of Gods Ordinance, we receiue them, the <hi>ſignification</hi> thereof by the <hi>geſture,</hi> cannot bee <hi>vnlawfull</hi> or <hi>vncomely,</hi> though it bee not <hi>ſimply neceſſary,</hi> but a matter of <hi>Order,</hi> not of <hi>proper</hi> worſhip in it ſelfe.</p>
               <p n="6">6. They therefore which ſpend their wits and time to prooue, either that wee ought not to giue <hi>Adoration</hi> to any ſanctified creature; or, by adoring it, to transferre our ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to God or Chriſt; or to perſwade men that this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture is vſed of vs, at leaſt for <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>eneration</hi> of the conſecrated creatures, had (in my opinion) too much time to ſpare, and not either Iudgment or Charitie enough. For it is not done in relation to the Signes, or ſimply to the things ſignified, but only as an expreſſion of our <hi>humble and gratefull acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of what we receiue,</hi> and is to the honouring of God and Chriſt by <hi>Conſequent</hi> and <hi>reduction</hi> onely belonging, and that but as an outward and <hi>free</hi> Rite or formalitie.</p>
               <p n="7">7. But if in the Supper it ſelfe wee had reſpect vnto the ſanctified creatures, as the ordinances of our Lord; and, by bowing our ſelues, not to them, but vpon occaſion of them then brought to vs to bee received, not reſting the honour or adoration in the elements themſelues, though ſanctified, but onely referring it to God and Chriſt the Son of God, not as carnally preſent in them, but ſitting in heaven, and by his Spirit wonderfully communicating his body and blood to vs; you ſee wee ſhould haue had M. <hi>Calvins</hi> approbation, as well as the ancient Fathers, S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> and others which I could name, and not heerein deſerue to bee matched with ſuch of the learned Papiſts, as would haue no Adoration to determine in the Images themſelues, but to be referred vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and reſt vpon the Prototype, or firſt Sampler.</p>
               <p n="8">8. For the Lords <hi>Sacraments</hi> and <hi>Word</hi> are, (as <hi>Calvin</hi> ſaith) the liuely images of God, and of his owne making, not

And therefore we may lawfully, and muſt haue ſuch a reſpect vnto them, as we may not haue to any thing deviſed by man; and wee may by them, (as <hi>obiectum à quo,</hi> by an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject from whence, and <hi>medium per quod,</hi> a meanes by which) tender our adoration to <hi>God,</hi> which by an Image of our own heads made, we cannot doe, without either breach of the 1 <hi>Commandement,</hi> if the adoration determine in the image, or prototype thereof being a meere creature; or breach of the 2 <hi>Commandment,</hi> though the adoration were referred only to God. For he hath ſaid, <hi>Thou ſhalt not make to thy ſelfe, &amp;c.</hi> but neuer meant to reſtraine himſelfe from ſuch repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of himſelfe, as he ſhould like to giue; or, vs from wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping him &amp; ſerving him in the vſe of them. See <hi>Cap.</hi> 9.</p>
               <p>And hence it is, that the people of God, before and after the Law, haue taken notice of Gods preſence or grace ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted by <hi>meſſage,</hi> as <hi>Exod.</hi> 4. or <hi>ſignes</hi> ordinary or extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary given them of God, and haue with free conſciences thereupon kneeled or bowed downe themſelues to God vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, at, or before thoſe repreſentations of Gods ſpeciall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence or grace. Wherein if any man ſhall match them with <hi>Durand, Occham</hi> and others that worſhip Images, made at the will of men onely in relation to that which is worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, he ſhall be injurious to the Saints, and giue incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to that Popiſh conceit, without reaſon.</p>
               <p>The Author of <hi>Altare Damaſc.</hi> yeeldeth that the Iewes, at, or before the <hi>Arke,</hi> which was Gods inſtituted ſigne of his preſence, or <hi>Temple</hi> in reſpect of the Arke, and ſo before the <hi>burning buſh, Ex.</hi> 3. or <hi>armed man Ioſh.</hi> 5. or <hi>cloud, Ex.</hi> 33.9. or other ſigne given of God as a ſigne of his ſpeciall preſence, might lawfully vpon ſight or reſpect of ſuch a ſigne, <hi>Adore</hi> God.

               <p>The concluſion of all, is, that if our Church intended that wee, in receiuing the Communion, ſhould looke vpon the Bread and Wine not ſimply as creatures, but as Sacraments of our Lords inſtitution, and ſo beholding them, <hi>Non quâ ſunt, ſed quâ ſignificant,</hi> not as they are in their owne nature, but as what they there ſignifie ſhould tender a <hi>knee-worſhip</hi> or Adoration, not at all to them, but only to God or Chriſt his ſonne, by occaſion of them, we ſhould therein doe no more then the ancient godly Fathers did before Poperie, as that learned tract <hi>Dialecticon Euchariſtiae</hi> ſheweth; I am ſure no more then the godly Iewes did, as hath beene ſhewed.

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:7305:24"/>
worſhip of God, are in all particulars, when they moſt agree to the generall Rules of the word, only <hi>Allowed.</hi> And yet, if by the neglect and contempt of ſuch externall Rites, <hi>Viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur aliquo modo ſanctitas cultus religioſi,</hi> the purity of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous worſhip bee violated (as Doctor <hi>Amer</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Ibid.

               <p>And indeed if wee will admit no more into the worſhip of God then is <hi>commanded,</hi> as the Anabaptiſts require, wee ſhall, in baptizing, onely <hi>lay on water in the name of the Father, of the Sonne and of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and not vſe (<hi>lawfully</hi>) any of thoſe ſet prayers, before or after, nor rehearſe the ſumme of the Chriſtian faith, nor haue any ſpeciall witneſſes, nor then giue the name as it were to ſhew that wee are as it were without a name, or being <hi>Lo-ammy</hi> till wee bee entred into profeſſed Couenant with God; nor, any Scripture then read to ſhew the lawfulneſſe of baptizing Infants, no Interroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories to expreſſe the conditions of our Couenant with god; and not onely, no ſigne of the <hi>Croſſe</hi> as a <hi>monitorie</hi> Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to the congregation, foraſmuch as God hath not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded any of theſe <hi>thus</hi> to bee done, in the vſe of that Sacrament.</p>
               <p>The like may bee ſaid of all the Readings, Prefaces, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations and Prayers (excepting that only which by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating the inſtitution, and praying for the bleſſing of God on vs in that vſe of them) are preſcribed in our <hi>Leitourgy,</hi> euen till wee come to the <hi>breaking</hi> of the <hi>Bread</hi> and to <hi>diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution</hi> of it and the Cup. Namely, that theſe, ſo farre as by the will of man they are deuiſed, and determined thus to be done, They are not things in their particular thus com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded of God, and therefore <hi>Ex ſe,</hi> of themſelues, are not proper worſhip of God, reſpectiuely to that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>forme, Order,</hi> and <hi>time</hi> of vſing them; But either as they are in their owne Generall, as the prayers; or, referred to <hi>Order, Comelineſſe</hi> and <hi>Edification,</hi> which God hath

commanded to bee aimed at, and obſerued in all actions of his worſhip, <hi>i. e. propter aliud,</hi> for ſome other thing. So then in themſelues only allowed, and Improperly worſhip of God.</p>
               <p>And if in ſuch things thus deviſed and determined by men, which are not in themſelues neceſſary, but onely law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, there may be no reſpect at all of honouring God in the vſe of them, though not <hi>ſimply</hi> for themſelues; How hath the Apoſtle told vs that <hi>one man eateth</hi>; or, <hi>obſerueth the day to the Lord,</hi> and <hi>another eateth not</hi>; or, <hi>obſerueth not the day</hi>; and, this man <hi>eateth not</hi>; and, <hi>obſerueth not the day, euen vnto the Lord?</hi> Or, what ground of faith could men haue in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things ſo contrary, as <hi>eating</hi> and <hi>not eating</hi>; vnleſſe it were, that God had <hi>allowed</hi> either, but <hi>commanded</hi> neither the one nor the other?

               <p>A man is bound, at ſuch a time, to pay an hundred pounds in current Engliſh money.

But where God hath <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded</hi> only the <hi>maine ſubſtance</hi> of a ſeruice to him, and not preſcribed the <hi>particular maners,</hi> but onely giuen rules of <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,</hi> thoſe particular circumſtances are not any worſhip or ſeruice of God in themſelues, nor may without Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be ſo eſteemed, but only as they are parts of <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Decency,</hi> and ſerue to the <hi>Edification</hi> of men, which God hath required in all the maine Actions of his preſcribed ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, <hi>i.e.</hi> the particulars are <hi>propter aliud,</hi> in reference to ſome what elſe a worſhip of God, and in themſelues onely <hi>allowed</hi> not <hi>commanded meanes</hi> thereof.</p>
               <p>I maruaile ſometimes at ſome of our brethren, who, to proue that wee make our Ceremonies a very worſhip to God, tell vs that if the very ſame things were done to the very ſame end by <hi>Diuine inſtitution,</hi> they muſt needs bee <hi>worſhip</hi>; and then <hi>true worſhip,</hi> becauſe <hi>required</hi> of God, and therefore ours muſt needs bee worſhip of God; and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing commanded, <hi>Will-worſhip.</hi> As if they had not yet learned, That the onely <hi>command</hi> of God doth make that to bee in it ſelfe, an Act of neceſſary and ſubſtantiall worſhip to him, which though to the ſame end, and in the ſame manner done voluntarily, nor was, nor is eſteemed any part of the reall worſhip in it ſelfe, but onely <hi>per &amp; propter aliud,</hi> by and for ſome reference to ſome other thing. As for example. The building and vſe of Altars here or there, before God had choſen out the ſtanding place for his Altar (though to the ſame end, for which the Lords inſtituted altar ſerued, <hi>i e.</hi> for <hi>Sacrifice</hi>) was not worſhip in reſpect of the <hi>place,</hi> or <hi>kind of ſtone</hi> vſed, or <hi>height, length,</hi> or <hi>breadth</hi>; But onely as an <hi>allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Inſtrument</hi> of the neceſſary worſhip, not ſanctifying the offering, as did Gods ſanctified Altar, but ſanctified, in a ſort, by the offering.</p>
               <p>To conclude, All that either in truth is, or may be eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med a proper and neceſſary part of Diuine worſhip, and meanes of honouring God, euen in the thing ſo done, muſt
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:7305:26"/>
bee ſo made by the will of God, or elſe is vaine and will-worſhip.</p>
               <p>But ſuch things as are not vnderſtood, or vſed, as in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues neceſſary, immediate, and proper worſhip of God, but onely by accident, and <hi>propter aliud,</hi> in reference are worſhip but <hi>after a ſort</hi> in themſelues, and haue no <hi>Precept</hi> of God vpon themſelues, in their <hi>particular,</hi> but onely an <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance</hi> or <hi>Generall</hi> warrant. And this is no otherwiſe a <hi>Will-worſhip,</hi> then was the worſhip of the <hi>freewill offerings,</hi> wherein the <hi>particular</hi> choiſe was left free to the men them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. Onely, if a man will enhaunce the value of this <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper</hi> and <hi>reductiue</hi> worſhip, and haue it goe currant at a higher rate, then God euer allowed, euen for proper ſeruice in it ſelfe, hee ſhall then make of his improper worſhip, a proper will-worſhip to Gods dishonour, in as much as hee will needs returne it to God at another rate, then God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſet vpon it in his <hi>allowance.</hi> Which is as one ſhould offer to pay the Kings Subjects in ſiluer or gold pieces, rated aboue the value, which the King himſelfe hath ſet on them. This is a non-payment, though the <hi>Species</hi> or particular kind, bee currant, becauſe the value is not right. And when men thinke to honour God by ſuch meanes, ſo eſteemed, they diſhonour him, not ſimply in the meanes, but becauſe of the miſprizing and abuſe. And ſo much for this <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> now to the next.</p>

               <p>When the day of Mercy ſhined on the Church of God, and gaue men ſtrength and ſpirit to withdraw themſelues from that leprous Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> nothing was more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, then to make the people know, that <hi>the vaine pompe and Stage-playes of human Rites which went then currant for an high ſeruice of God</hi> (while in the meane time his owne pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed ſeruice, was either obſcured and defaced, or annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated and neglected) <hi>was no true ſeruice of God.</hi> Hence, you ſhall find the Diuines of that time labouring mainely vpon this point, That nothing may bee eſteemed or vſed as a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:7305:27"/>
of God, ſuch as hee would reward, and men might not omit without ſinne, (which was and is the rate of all the Popiſh Ceremonies in their accounts, from the greateſt to the leaſt of them) ſaue onely what God himſelfe hath in his word preſcribed. In the meane time they denyed not a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to the Church, for ordaining of things for <hi>Order, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,</hi> and <hi>Edification</hi>; and ſuch, and ſo many, as the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Church ſhould at any time require.

               <p>Hereupon ſundry well minded people began to thinke of all that in Popery was made part of the diuine worſhip, and vrged as neceſſary for conſcience ſake, to bee ſo obſerued to the honour of God: And not conſidering warily, whether things were at all <hi>in themſelues</hi> too blame, or only in reſpect of the <hi>ſuperſtitious vſe</hi> and <hi>opinion</hi> of them, they concluded, that all was vnlawfull to bee vſed in any Act of religious ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, which was not <hi>commanded</hi> (which, of ſeruice properly ſo to bee called, is true) and thereupon reſolued, no <hi>Temples, Bels, Fonts, Goſſips, &amp;c.</hi> And becauſe they found not a plaine command for an <hi>Oath</hi> in caſes of Iudicature; no <hi>ſwearing:</hi> and, for the like reaſon, <hi>no Baptizing of Infants,</hi> No <hi>ſet formes of prayer,</hi> or <hi>Order of reading Scripture</hi> ſince it is not in the Bible; no <hi>habits,</hi> no <hi>geſtures,</hi> but ſuch as were neceſſary in common vſe; nothing at all obſerued which might haue any particular reference to any thing <hi>Diuine</hi> or <hi>Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call,</hi> not ſo much as a <hi>Cloake</hi> or <hi>Gowne</hi> for a Miniſter as a <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctiue</hi> garment, nor ought elſe which might bee called <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall.</hi> And as men went with more or fewer ſayles ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried along with this conceite, ſo haue they fallen ſhort or gone further in their miſapplication of the true ground of Diuinity, which our great Diuines had deliuered <hi>ex hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſi,</hi> conditionally and in a ſtrict ſenſe of the termes [<hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God.</hi>]</p>
               <p>From hence, in the firſt <hi>Admonition to the Parliament,</hi> they quarrelled at the frame and forme of our Church-or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; and, ſet downe this rule, <hi>whatſoeuer is not commanded
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:7305:27"/>
of God in his word may not bee recieued in the Church.</hi> This, when Maſter <hi>Cartwright</hi> vndertooke to defend againſt the late Arch-biſhop, Doctor <hi>Whirgife,</hi> hee (as hee was a man of a great wit and parts) found how that ſpeech might bee mainetainable, and yet ſome liberty left vnto the Church in conſtituting matters of Order; namely, that in as much as the things left vnto the Churches determination, were limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to certaine <hi>generall</hi> rules of the word which are <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements,</hi> therefore the <hi>partioul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For though thoſe <hi>generall</hi> rules bee <hi>Precepts,</hi> yet the various <hi>ſpecialties</hi> which fall vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them are not thereby <hi>commanded</hi> (not thoſe, <hi>ſpecially</hi>) but onely <hi>allowed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But when this Anſwer was found too ſhort to ſmite downe our Ceremonies, for which, this was pleaded, that they were not <hi>contrary</hi> but <hi>agreeable</hi> to the ſtatutes of Gods word; and, as ſuch, intended, and to bee vſed; and that, if they would diſproue any thing they muſt inſiſt vpon that particular, and not thinke to condemne it by a generall Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, as Maſter <hi>Hooker</hi> told them: Then they ſought out a new way, <hi>i. e.</hi> That <hi>things left to the Churches diſpoſe, are only Circumſtances of time and place, and ſuch things of</hi> Decorum <hi>as were as well receiued and practiſed for like ends in common vſe, as in Eccleſiaſticall.</hi> And by this rare deuiſe (which I take to bee Maſter <hi>Iacobs</hi>) they haue made a ſhift to reſcue <hi>Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, Bels, Fonts, a Communion-table</hi> and <hi>Cloath,</hi> and <hi>Cup,</hi> and if need bee, a <hi>Church yard</hi> to bury in, and ſome few other matters from the ſentence of the Rigid Anabaptiſts. But haue left all other things, which are (as they ſpeake) <hi>ſtated in, i. e. appropriated to any actions of Gods externall ſeruice,</hi> to bee executed as guilty of ſome treachery againſt god, in his worſhip. <hi>Therefore</hi> (ſaith Maſter <hi>Iacob) God hath not left vnto the Churches liberty or determination, ſo much as our Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall Ceremonies.</hi> Which (a better man then hee, and one that from my heart I both loue and honour) Doctor <hi>Ames</hi>

Of which ſentence the former halfe is moſt true; the later, not ſo ſound.

Now, as <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Decencie</hi> in the outward manner of handling all and the ſeverall parts of Gods inſtituted ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, is required of the Churches; ſo is it, that all bee done to Edification; which is not that <hi>all,</hi> that men luſt to impoſe vnder the name of Order, Decency, and Edification, is <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded</hi> or <hi>allowed</hi> by that charge of the Holy Ghoſt; but that <hi>all,</hi> which ſhee is to <hi>diſpoſe</hi> of, be ſuch indeed, ſo farre as ſhe can judge.

               <head>CAP. XVIII. Six Queſtions about <hi>Kneeling</hi> anſwered.</head>
               <p>Queſt. 1. <hi>WHether you allow kneeling to bee worſhip.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Worſhip is either <hi>Cultus</hi> Seruice, or <hi>Adoration</hi> or <hi>Veneration</hi>: kneeling is a part of <hi>externall Adoration per ſe</hi> in it ſelfe, as is the being <hi>bare-headed</hi>; but, not <hi>Cultus ex ſe,</hi> ſeruice or worſhip of it ſelfe, but <hi>per aliud,</hi> with reference to another thing, as it is a ſigne of true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall reuerence acknowledged to God, and a part of that comelineſſe which becometh men in partaking the ſeales of the Couenant of grace, done to his honour. It is in it ſelfe no more then a <hi>Circumſtance</hi> of worſhip, like as Faſting is, of <hi>Humiliation</hi> and Prayer; in a word, <hi>Cultus reductiue non proprie dictus,</hi> worſhip <hi>reductiuely,</hi> not <hi>properly</hi> ſo called; <hi>law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,</hi> not <hi>commanded,</hi> as before hath beene ſhewed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object. But, if this bee not worſhip, there is no worſhip of the body?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I <hi>Anſwer,</hi> yes; for the very bodily Action of <hi>Eating</hi> and <hi>Drinking</hi> in the Supper, is, on the Receiuers part, <hi>Cultus dei externus,</hi> externall worſhip of God, becauſe commanded. So is the bodily <hi>ſpeaking</hi> in <hi>preaching</hi> and <hi>prayer</hi> publickely. Howbeit I confeſſe, that, of the geſtures, there is no bodily worſhip, <hi>i. e. Cultus Dei ex ſe,</hi> worſhip in and of themſelues: Nor, <hi>religious Adoration,</hi> but <hi>ex intentione,</hi> in reſpect of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention onely: For, God hath not differenced <hi>Diuine</hi> and <hi>Ciuill</hi> Adoration by <hi>geſture</hi>; yet is ours, <hi>religious,</hi> in this vſe.</p>
               <p>Queſt. 2. <hi>Whether, if it bee; it may be lawfull for men to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe any thing of it, to any other action of worſhip then is war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable, either by</hi> Precept, or Example.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> That which all men might of themſelues lawfully doe in the Action of Gods worſhip, the Gouernours of the Church and Magiſtrate may lawfully require to bee done of them all, <hi>i.e.</hi> So, as they might lawfully haue done it <hi>libera conſcientia</hi> with a free conſcience. Indeed if God had tyed it onely to ſome one ordinance of his, by <hi>Precept,</hi> neither men, nor Angels might tranſlate it. Warrant by <hi>Example</hi>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:7305:33"/>
you haue before, from the vſe of Gods people in ſeuerall ſorts of his worſhip. And that the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> it ſelfe is an Action of diuine worſhip, who dare deny? But I take no <hi>examples</hi> to bee warrants to vs further then they are war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted by the <hi>Word.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Queſt. 3. <hi>VVhere the Church hath power giuen to it, to ordaine any Ceremony? Indeed it hath power to direct and take care for</hi> Decencie <hi>and</hi> Order, 1. Cor. 14.40. <hi>But</hi> order <hi>is no</hi> Ceremony, <hi>nor</hi> Action, <hi>but the</hi> accommodation <hi>of</hi> Vbi, Quando Prius, Poſterius, <hi>and neceſſary circumſtances to ſuch actions as bee preſcribed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I haue immediately declared the Churches com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion out of 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.26.40. and ſhewed how, for the reaſon of <hi>Order, Decencie</hi> and <hi>Edification,</hi> the Church muſt needs ordaine ſome Ceremonies. For if at all there be none, Religion (as touching the <hi>ſolemnity</hi> of it) will come to bee as ſome haue ſaid (which <hi>Chamier</hi> alſo obſerues) as it were but a <hi>name.</hi>

               <p>The late deuiſe of <hi>circumſtances,</hi> I haue ſhewed before, euen the <hi>Place</hi> for publicke worſhip; and, <hi>houre of mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> (which men would haue to bee nothing but <hi>circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> as they are deſigned to that ſpeciall vſe) are <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> not <hi>qua ſunt, ſed qua inſeruiunt cultui ſacro,</hi> as they are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruient to diuine worſhip. Therefore doth <hi>Zanchie</hi> call them, <hi>Ceremonies.</hi> And if <hi>place</hi> and <hi>time,</hi> as they fall vnder ſuch obſeruation, bee no Ceremonies, then neither the <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle</hi> nor <hi>ſolemne Feaſts</hi> were Ceremonies. Theſe were, I confeſſe, <hi>Diuine,</hi> as <hi>commanded</hi>; thoſe, are, in their <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar determination, Humane</hi>; yet, <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> in their vſe and reference to the worſhip then and there to be done to God.</p>
               <p>Queſt. 4. <hi>VVhether it bee any leſſe then Idolatry to annex grace vnto any thing ſaue vnto Gods owne Ordinances, which our</hi> Declaration <hi>ſeemes to doe, acknowledging the Ceremonies profitable to Edification, and ſtirring vp of our dull mindes to minde holy duties; vnleſſe wee ſay, Edification, and quickening of the heart bee no Graces.</hi>

                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:7305:33"/>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is <hi>Idolatria interpretatiua,</hi> interpretatiue idolatry to aſcribe to any creature (yea, though ſanctified by Gods ordinance) the <hi>efficiency</hi> of grace, which none can worke as a <hi>cauſe</hi> thereof, <hi>efficiently,</hi> but God. But it is neither idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, nor vnbeſeeming vs, to acknowledge any meanes by which grace is wrought through the power of God, not wrapped in them, but reſident in himſelfe that freely gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the grace by the right vſe of them. This wee aſcribe to Gods <hi>Sacraments,</hi> but not to <hi>Church ceremonies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Declaration,</hi> you ſpeake of, onely ſaith; that <hi>ſome of our Ceremonies are apt:</hi> it doth not ſay, <hi>able</hi> to ſtirre vp our dull mindes; and, not <hi>apt</hi> to doe that, by any <hi>vertue</hi> in them, or <hi>from God by them</hi> to vs; but onely, as <hi>externall obiects</hi> and <hi>occaſions</hi> whereby our minds worke vpon themſelues; for it is ſaid, <hi>by ſome notable and ſpeciall ſignification.</hi>

                  <hi>Neque enim vllus ſanus aſſeruit omnia in Scripturis contineri quae mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum aliquod habent ad fide &amp; pietate animos informandos, ſed duntaxat omnia dogmata fidéi &amp; pietatis. Praeter haec autem, plurima ſunt, in quibus non eſt nullum eiuſmodi momentum,</hi> nor did euer ſound Diuine affirme all things to bee conteined in Scriptures which haue any vſe at all for information of mens minds touching faith and piety; but onely that all doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines of faith and piety are there: But beſides theſe (doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines) there are very many things which are not of no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vnto vs: <hi>Vt multa naturalia, in quibus authorem mundi licet agnoſcere; in Eccleſia, Ritus &amp; Ceremoniae,</hi> as many natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall things, in which wee may learne to acknowledge the Creator of the world; <hi>in the Church Rites and Ceremonies.</hi> Where you ſee that, as vnto Gods creatures, ſo vnto <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall Rite and Ceremonies</hi> not conteined in the word, hee graunteth ſome furtherance to <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>piety</hi> not <hi>efficienter,</hi> as an efficient, but <hi>obiectiue,</hi> by way of object. And <hi>Calvin</hi> requireth, that Ceremonies made for <hi>decorum,</hi> comelineſſe,<note place="margin">Calv. Inſt. <hi>4.10.28.</hi>
                  </note> ſhould bee ſuch as breed a <hi>veneration</hi> of Gods ordinances, to the end that <hi>talibus adminiculis ad pietatem excitemur,</hi> by ſuch helpes wee might bee excited vnto piety. At whoſe words, any man that will, may quarrell as iuſtly, as at our <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration.</hi>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:7305:34"/>
And indeed, all Ceremonies that ſome way are not <hi>apt to edifie vs</hi> are <hi>vnprofitable</hi>; and yet, the <hi>effecting of grace</hi> may not bee aſcribed to any ſuch.</p>
               <p>Queſt. 5. <hi>I deſire to know whether our Ceremonies bee not within the compaſſe of thoſe things that periſh with the vſing</hi> (i. e. <hi>that leaue no grace, or ought elſe behind them) which are according to the commandements of men, and if they bee, how we can ſubmit our ſelues to their bondage, contrary to the Apoſtles preſcription?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I take not our Ceremonies to be within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of thoſe things,<note place="margin">Col. 2.</note> of which the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>they periſh in the vſing (i.e.</hi> they come to no ſuch vſe or <hi>end</hi> as is aimed at in them) becauſe thoſe (as <hi>Zanchie</hi> ſheweth) were ſuch obſeruances as men deuiſed, or vſed, with an eſtimation of worſhiping God in them <hi>ex ſe</hi> as of themſelues, and that the conſcience is imbondaged to that ſuperſtition. For that, being downe right will-worſhip (when, to Gods owne <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept,</hi> other things were <hi>added</hi> by men, as <hi>neceſſary,</hi> and <hi>bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the conſcience,</hi> as <hi>Zanchie</hi> ſaith) could yeeld nothing to men but their labour for their paines. Like as, in <hi>Math.</hi> 15. <hi>In vaine they worſhip mee, teaching for doctrine (i.e.</hi> impoſing vpon the conſcience) <hi>mens Traditions</hi>; as if they could not be left, without ſinne. For the tradition was, that <hi>to eat with vnwaſhen hands, defiled a man as much as whoredome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But in vſing Rites and Ceremonies preſcribed for order, decency and edification, nor as neceſſary in themſelues at all, nor as any worſhip of God <hi>per ſe,</hi> by and of themſelues, nor as binding the conſcience, <hi>extra caſum ſcandali &amp; contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> without the caſe of ſcandale and contempt, wee attaine the end of our obſeruance, which is, the diſcharge of our duties to our Gouernours, the peace of the Church, and our Miniſtery. And the Church obtaineth her end, that the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of God is outwardly ſo <hi>ordered.</hi> And if the ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of God bee, by mens prejudice, not the more regarded, but rather the leſſe; or, that they which need not the helpe of ſuch externall Rites, ſhall deſpiſe them; or, others, through careleſnes or ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce ſhal make no vſe of any ſuch <hi>Monition,</hi> as is, by a Ceremony, preſented to their remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance;
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:7305:34"/>
yet ſhall the fruite remaine to vs, according to that which wee haue ſowed.</p>
               <p>Therefore to the ſecond member of this fifth Queſtion (which ſuppoſeth that which I will not graunt) I need not Anſwer. But, on the contrary, pray you to conſider, if by the <hi>Tradition onely of men,</hi> without my word of God, wee ſhall ſay to our ſelues, <hi>weare not a linnen Garment in Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, make not the ſigne of the Croſſe in B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Verely, I cannot ſee but ſuch feare of God is in vaine, becauſe, by, and from the onely precepts of men; and all that is ſo done, periſheth in the vſing; and though God in mercy may, and will forgiue this ſinne of their ignorance; yet they can for this haue no reward of God; for, who required this at their hands? Standeth the kingdome of God in ſuch things, or his ſeruice?<note place="margin">Tom. <hi>4.</hi> lib. <hi>15.</hi> cap. <hi>14.</hi> ſ. <hi>16.</hi>
                  </note> I conclude in the words of <hi>Chamier, Nam quia noluit ſpiritus quicquam oneris imponere Eccleſiae, in rebus quidem indifferentibus, certe qui ijſdem ſiue vſurpandis ſiue cauendis legem ponit,</hi> becauſe the ſpirit would not impoſe any burden on the Church in things indifferent, certainely hee that impoſeth a Law touching either the <hi>vſing</hi> or ſhunning of thoſe things: (<hi>i.e.</hi> as hee hath before interpreted, as <hi>binding the conſcience) Hune no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe eſt per conſequentiam contradicere legibus prius poſitis,</hi> viz. Deut. 4.2. and Deut. 12. <hi>Non addes, &amp;c.</hi> It muſt needs bee that ſuch an one by conſequence doth contradict thoſe lawes impoſed of God, <hi>thou ſhalt not adde to, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Queſt. 6. <hi>I deſire to know, whether wee may with good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, ſuffer the making of Gods Commandements voyd by our owne Traditions, as wee doe in preſſing theſe Ceremonies with ſo much violence, and inflicting ſuch ſharpe puniſhments on the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of them, and paſſing by Adultery and Drunkenneſſe, &amp;c. as veniall ſinnes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I take your meaning to bee, by <hi>the Traditions of
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:7305:35"/>
men,</hi> when you ſay [by <hi>our owne Traditions,</hi>] and that you meane [as <hi>they,</hi> or <hi>ſome</hi> doe,] when you ſay [<hi>as wee doe in preſſing them.</hi>] For, wee that are called onely to the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, whether <hi>Private</hi> men or <hi>Miniſters</hi> are preſſed, but preſſe them not. And then I anſwer 1. That the preſſing of leſſer duties, more then greater, <hi>caeteris paribus</hi> is a ſinne, which wee may not ſuffer to goe without Cenſure, or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe, when we haue opportunity. But that we ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt it by not obſerving the leſſer dutie, becauſe they ſinne who preſſe it more then a greater, will not hold. For of thoſe that did ſo, and are for ſo doing reprooved, our Lord ſaith, <hi>Theſe greater things ye ought to haue done, and not to haue left the other vndone. Math.</hi> 23.23.</p>
               <p>If you object, That <hi>tything of Mints and Cumin</hi> were du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties contained in the <hi>Law,</hi> but ours bee Ceremonies inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by <hi>men.</hi> I grant that difference; but yet ſay, that if they be ſuch as haue <hi>allowance</hi> in the Word as <hi>lawfull,</hi> the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of them is a dutie on our part to bee performed for Conſcience ſake, though not of the thing for it ſelfe, (as in all things <hi>commanded</hi> of God) yet for Conſcience ſake of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to our Prince and Governours, whom, in <hi>lawfull</hi> things God hath commanded vs to obey. So I take it to be a dutie to doe this; though, a greater dutie (becauſe imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately commanded) and ſimply neceſſary at all times, to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine from whoredome and drunkenneſſe &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I anſwer, that a leſſer fault in it ſelfe, may ſometimes be juſtly more puniſhable then a greater; as when a greater is confeſſed, and a leſſer defended; or, when hee that hath power to inflict grievous penalties in the leſſer caſe, hath not Commiſſion to doe ſo in the greater, which is our Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops caſe,<note place="margin">See D <hi>Ames</hi> his Booke of <hi>Conſcience, pa.</hi> 304. <hi>ſ.</hi> 6. firſt Edition.</note> wherein the fault is in the Lawes, not in the Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. And 3. That a thing which is in it ſelfe the leſſer e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, may be for the conſequence the greater; as, ſtealing of grapes in the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> is worſe then <hi>Burglary,</hi> or breaking of an houſe in the night, though a man ſteale not to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of ſix pence, is more obnoxious then ſtealing an herd of cattell with vs. Which I ſpeak not to excuſe any man, who willingly doth purſue theſe lighter matters more eagerly
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:7305:35"/>
then the more important; but to ſhew, that your rule of <hi>greater</hi> and <hi>leſſer,</hi> muſt be vnderſtood <hi>cateris paribus,</hi> with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to circumſtances, and not abſolutely.</p>
               <p n="4">4. I anſwer, that though it be a ſinne not to be ſuffered without reproofe, to preſſe the lighter things more eagerly then the more important; yet doth not that neceſſarily make voyd the Commandment of God, but onely miſplace it. The making voyd of Gods commaund by mans Tradition, is, when men of themſelues appoynt ſomething to be done, which may diſcharge the conſcience from the bond of that which God hath commaunded. And this was the caſe of which our Lord ſpake,<note place="margin">Marke 7.11.</note> 
                  <hi>Thus you make the Commandement of God of none effect</hi>; namely, becauſe they taught, that <hi>if a man had once ſworne by the Offering, that his father or mother ſhould haue nothing by him.</hi> That this oath ſhould free him from the Conſcience of honouring (with my reliefe) his father or mother.</p>
               <p>Indeed if our Ceremonies were ſo delivered vnto vs, we ought not to ſuffer them, but to reproue the tender of them, and reject the vſe. Yea if at all they were delivered by our Church as <hi>neceſſary in themſelues,</hi> or as <hi>proper parts</hi> of the ſervice of God in which we vſe them; or, not as <hi>meere Rites</hi> of indifferent nature, and <hi>mooueable</hi> at the Churches plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and ſuch as (were it not for Order, Diſcipline, &amp; Peace ſake in the Church) we might, without any offence to God, as well leaue, as vſe. For though this Condition, ſhould not make void any one of the ten commandments as did that of the Iewes, yet becauſe it is contrary to the Law which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddeth all addition to it ſelfe, that is, as <hi>Chamier</hi> ſaith, to bind the Conſcience <hi>per ſe,</hi> by and of it ſelfe, we might not ſuffer that impietie to paſſe without contradiction; nor, by our Conformity countenance ſuch a ſuperſtition.</p>
               <p>And as this is true on that hand, ſo is it on the other, that if any man, how holy, learned, or good ſoeuer, ſhall deliuer this <hi>tradition</hi> to men (not hauing any word of God for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe) <hi>You may not weare a Surplice in Gods Seruice,</hi> nor <hi>make the ſigne of the Croſſe at Baptiſme on the childs forehead,</hi> nor <hi>kneele in receiuing the Lords Supper</hi>; for if you doe, you ſhall

               <p>Nor can it bee ſaid, that the one ſide doth vrge Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie more eagerly then the other doth Inconformitie. For they vrge Inconformitie directly for Conſcience ſake to God; and affirme, that it is <hi>Ignorance,</hi> or <hi>an ill Conſcience</hi> in any man to vſe them, or both: whereas the other vrge them not at all to be vſed for any Conſcience ſake, or neceſſitie in themſelues, but onely for Conſcience ſake, becauſe they are determined and impoſed as matters of <hi>Order,</hi> and <hi>externall government</hi> by lawfull authoritie.</p>
               <p>Indeed the Church-Officers inflict more grievous penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties vpon the refuſall of theſe, as hauing authoritie of Law. But the other, at leaſt ſome of them, inflict deeper wounds, by caſting all men which <hi>conforme,</hi> out of the hearts &amp; good opinion of all they can, as time-ſeruers, belly-gods, and what you will elſe that naught is.

               <p>I lament the preſſure of either ſide (if it could be holpen) with all my heart, and yet muſt remember this proverbe, <hi>Crudelem Medicum intemperans aeger facit,</hi> the intemperance of the Patient, puts the Phyſician vpon an harſh courſe of cure.

               <p>So that ſo long as that Decree for <hi>ſtanding</hi> in their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke ſeruice kept any life in it, there was no decree for <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doration</hi> of the Sacrament, by <hi>kneeling</hi> to or before it.</p>

               <p>For graunting that the <hi>people</hi> doe <hi>Kneele</hi> in <hi>receiuing,</hi> (as did alſo the <hi>Prieſt,</hi> till ſuch time as the doctrine of <hi>Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation</hi> begot the <hi>Canon</hi> of his <hi>ſtanding,</hi> for feare of <hi>ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ought</hi>) I deny, that <hi>Kneeling</hi> in the very time of <hi>Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing,</hi> was euer in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> any <hi>Rite</hi> of, or for <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doration</hi> of the Sacrament it ſelfe, or any creature, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not <hi>Idolatrous.</hi> I deny not the errour of their <hi>mindes</hi> concerning that they <hi>receiued</hi> into their <hi>mouthes.</hi> But I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that they euer intended <hi>Adoration</hi> of the <hi>Species,</hi> at that moment of time when they tooke it in their <hi>mouthes:</hi> But then turned themſelues to God rather, to giue him <hi>thankes,</hi> which was not vncomely.</p>

               <p>I conclude therefore, that it is impoſſible to proue, that the geſture of <hi>Kneeling</hi> at that moment of <hi>receiuing</hi> the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, was in the very Church of <hi>Rome idolatrouſly</hi> inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the Sacrament.</p>
               <p>And as touching the <hi>Introduction</hi> thereof by any Pope, I alſo deny that to bee proued, or probable (if meaning) of <hi>kneeling with reſpect to the Sacrament in the very moment of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing it.</hi> For there is not to this day, any decree of any Pope or Councell, ſo much as that it ſhould bee <hi>taken Knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of all the Communicants,</hi> much leſſe for <hi>Adoration</hi> of the Sacrament it ſelfe.</p>

And a third I remember in the <hi>Order of Salamanca</hi> for the <hi>Fryers.</hi> But all theſe concerne onely the <hi>Clergy,</hi> who comming to receiue ſo neere the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, are appointed to doe it <hi>kneeling</hi> on the greeces or ſteps of the Altar, which is done in <hi>veneration</hi> of the <hi>Altar,</hi> or of that which ſtandeth thereupon, and not for Adoration to the <hi>Hoaſt</hi> when it is put into, their mouthes, and is not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen as a rule to all the people whereuer they communicate, or when it is communicated to them.</p>
               <p>But it will bee perhaps objected. That <hi>the people of all ſorts doe receiue kneeling in their Churches.</hi> I graunt it, but I deny that euer it was by any Pope, ſince the <hi>Tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> deuiſed or impoſed vpon them as a <hi>Rite</hi> or <hi>Ceremony</hi> to bee obſerued in <hi>receiuing.</hi> For then, wee ſhould ſurely ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther find <hi>when,</hi> and by <hi>whom</hi>; or, at leaſt, that it was done, or had not beene ſo before, which I doe not beleeue that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man can ſhew.</p>
               <p>And the reaſon why there neuer was any conſtitution made in the Romane Church for this geſture, was, as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue three fold. 1. Becauſe if they had made, til of later ages, ſuch a Law, they had openly croſſed the ancient Rite and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons made <hi>againſt Kneeling on the Lords-dayes and Pentecoſt,</hi> in any their ſolemne worſhip of God. Therefore they ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther liked to winke at the cloſer breach of that Canon, by ſuch as out of priuate deuotion ſhould <hi>kneele,</hi> when their turne came to <hi>receiue,</hi> on thoſe dayes of <hi>Station,</hi> then to croſſe that by another Canon expreſly. Secondly, becauſe they found all men but of a generall deuotion and deſire of honouring God in that Action, of themſelues to <hi>kneele,</hi> they did not find any need, to require that to bee done, which
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:7305:40"/>
was vniuerſally done of the people, by an ancient <hi>Cuſtome.</hi> And thirdly, becauſe this which had beene obſerued of old times, before their new conceit of a <hi>Reall preſence,</hi> ſeemed to giue better teſtimony to that conceit, then if the Ceremony had been by themſelues inſtituted. And indeed this we find, that when the doctrine of <hi>Reall-preſence</hi> by <hi>Conſubſtantiation,</hi> began to get head, which was aboue 100 yeares before the <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> the Patrons of that errour did plead the <hi>Adoration,</hi> which had beene generally obſerued in the vſe of the Supper before that (but with intendment of the ſame to Chriſt the Sonne of God, as <hi>ſitting in heauen,</hi> and not as <hi>exiſtent</hi> in or with the bread) to proue the Reall preſence thereby.

And in his time, and after, before the <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation,</hi>
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:7305:40"/>
they did Adore Chriſt as <hi>coexiſtent</hi> with the bread, which perhaps gaue occaſion to <hi>Auerrois</hi> (who liued eightie yeares before <hi>Honorius</hi>) to ſay that <hi>Chriſtians did adore their God, and then eate him.</hi> For, at that time, the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of <hi>Conſubſtantiation</hi> had gotten ſtrength, and they did as it were confine the <hi>locall</hi> preſence of Chriſt to the <hi>bread</hi> once ſanctified, at leaſt in the Sacramentall vſe of it, and did performe diuine honour to the Sonne of God as being ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.

The difference betwixt theſe and the former ages was, in this, That the former Ages did, in receiuing the Sacrament, <note n="c" place="margin">Adoring, as <hi>Aug.</hi> ſaid, not that which is <hi>ſeene and peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth,</hi> but that which is <hi>belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </note>adore Chriſt as ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>myſtically,</hi> as the <hi>ſignified thing</hi> is in the <hi>Signe,</hi> without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny opinion of Chriſts <hi>bodily preſence in the creatures them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues,</hi> or of alteration made in the <hi>ſubſtance,</hi> nature or forme of the creatures; whereas, that Age dreamed of a <hi>Conſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation,</hi> The following, did embrace that monſter of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi>; and then, when all the ſubſtance of the viſible creature was held to be gone, they did eaſily turne and entend the Adoration to the <hi>viſible things,</hi> as if there had beene now no <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of any creature left therein, but only the <hi>appearances</hi> of familiar creatures, vnder which, Chriſt himſelfe was <hi>ſubſtantially</hi>; but <hi>inuiſible.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That there was this difference, the writings of the ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Ages will manifeſt to any diligent Reader; and among other things, this cauſe (which is kept, I confeſſe, ſtill; though ſtripped of the ſenſe it had) that, <hi>in celebrating</hi> or <hi>conſecrating,</hi> the prayer was not made, that <hi>the Bread and Wine might bee made the body and blood of Chriſt in themſelues,</hi> as is now fanſied; but, <hi>Vt nobis accipientibus fiant corpus &amp; ſanguis Domini,</hi> to vs <hi>receiuing</hi> of them they may become the body and blood of the Lord. Intimating that the <hi>Reall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence</hi> of Chriſt (in a ſpirituall manner) is not effected <hi>in the viſible ſignes</hi>; but, <hi>in</hi> and <hi>vnto</hi> the <hi>faithfull Receiuer</hi> of them. And that all the conuerſion and changing of the Bread and Wine was only in their <hi>vſe,</hi> in that they were myſtically, and in type, the body and blood of Chriſt, as the <hi>Arke</hi> was
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:7305:41"/>
                  <hi>Iehouah,</hi> as the <hi>Rocke</hi> was <hi>Chriſt,</hi> 1. <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 10.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Adoration</hi> therfore of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the vſe of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, hath alwayes beene in the Chriſtian Church; Firſt, without any reference of diuine honour to the <hi>viſible things themſelues</hi> as being really turned into Chriſt, or containing him within themſelues. Afterwards, from the preuailing of <hi>Guilmund</hi> and other againſt <hi>Berengarine,</hi> and the truth, for a <hi>reall preſence</hi> of Chriſts <hi>conioyned with</hi> the bread, they directed their <hi>Adoration</hi> to the <hi>creatures</hi>; but, not for the creatures or Elements ſakes, but for Chriſts ſake. At laſt came in the Adoration of the Sacrament or <hi>viſible element</hi> of bread it ſelfe, as hauing no ſubſtance or materiall ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence, but onely the naturall Body of Chriſt by vertue of <hi>Conſecration,</hi> &amp; by <hi>Concomitance</hi> wholly Chriſt, who is God to be adored for euer. In the firſt times and ſecond, the ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration was onely in the <hi>vſe.</hi> For out of the Sacramentall vſe they did not beleeue ſuch a Reall preſence: but, after the abomination of Tranſubſtantiation once got the field, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there was then nothing of the creature ſuppoſed to be left, but the <hi>Accidents</hi>; and thoſe, as <hi>Bellar.</hi> himſelfe ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, vnited to the perſon of the Sonne of God. Then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, that whereſoeuer that appeared, <hi>Diuine honour</hi> was held fit to bee done thereto, as vnto the very Son of God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate, and certainely exiſtent vnder thoſe Species of <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi> as euer he was on the Croſſe, or in the wombe of his mother; onely (for feare of frighting vs) hee is pleaſed to bee there <hi>inviſible,</hi> and as after the manner of a Spirit, but yet in his very true naturall body, the ſame that was crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſay they. This moſt abominable Idolatrie followed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Tranſubſtantiation. But the two other ſorts of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doration of Chriſt in the vſe of the Sacrament went before this. The middle alſo was Idolatrous, not <hi>in obiecto,</hi> in the object, as the laſt, but <hi>interpretatiue,</hi> becauſe they conceiued very Chriſt to be coexiſtent, then, with the ſanctified Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; and as ſo, adored <hi>him,</hi> but not the <hi>viſible creatures.</hi> The firſt Adoring was vndoubtedly lawfull, when the ſanctified creatures were vnderſtood to bee the Body and Blood of Chriſt, not <hi>in rei veritate,</hi> as being changed the one into the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:7305:41"/>
other, or one coexiſtent with the other, but <hi>in ſignificante myſterio,</hi> in a ſignifying myſterie, as <hi>Auguſt.</hi> ſpake, made the Body and Blood of Chriſt, not by any alteration of their ſubſtance, forme, and nature, as <hi>Theodoret</hi>; but onely by their <hi>Inſtitution</hi> and <hi>Deputation</hi> to that vſe: and therefore were not the very Body and Blood of Chriſt, nor did exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit the ſame (as was after dreamed) to the <hi>mouth</hi> and <hi>bodie</hi> of euery Receiuer of them, but onely to the <hi>ſoule</hi> of the true beleeuers, who receiued ſpiritually and by faith, <hi>rem ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menti,</hi> the thing ſignified by the outward elements. For all that while, the adoration or diuine worſhip was directed only to Chriſt as ſitting at the right hand of God in heauen, and that in the act of <hi>Communicating.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence the 1. <hi>Nicene</hi> Councell exhorteth, that men ſhould not bee <hi>humiliter intenti,</hi> humbly intent to the things before them, but looke vp higher.

The <hi>Defendant</hi> borrowed not thoſe Teſtimonies from the Papiſts, (who were not the Owners but Abuſers of them;) but of the Fathers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, to whom (it is not vncomely to ſay) <hi>wee are debtors,</hi> and to God for them. 3. There is, by vs, nothing here ſaid for <hi>maintenance of our Ceremonies,</hi> which wee ſuppoſe to bee maintainable ſo far, as not to be <hi>vnlawfull</hi> by the Scriptures. The poynt herein hand, was onely matter of <hi>fact,</hi> viz. <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ancient Churches receiued the Communion adoring, yea, or no?</hi> The ſalt-biting of the Biſhop, (as <hi>borrowing proofs from the Papiſts maintenance of Popiſh ceremonies,</hi>) maketh nothing to the <hi>Anſwer</hi> of the evidence produced; but turneth the Readers mind, by a brackiſh gybe, from off the <hi>cauſe,</hi> to the <hi>perſons</hi> of the Biſhops, which is not plaine dealing.</p>

Chriſt is eaten: hee is eaten by parts in the Sacrament, and whole Chriſt remaines whole in heauen, whole Chriſt remaines whole in thy heart. Whereby is manifeſt that he beleeued not either <hi>Conſubſtantiation,</hi> or <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> but a <hi>Sacramentall eating</hi> of Chriſt in the myſteries apart, and a <hi>ſpirituall Communication</hi> of whole Chriſt to the heart, euen as wee doe. Hence he there alſo ſaith, <hi>Totum hoc quod in hac oblatione corporis &amp; ſanguinis Domini agitur, myſterium eſt; aliud videtur, aliud intelligitur, quod videtur ſpeeiem ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet corporalem, quod intelligitur</hi> (hee ſaith not <hi>quod ineſt) fructum habet ſpiritualem:</hi> All that is done in this oblation of the body and blood of the Lord, is a <hi>Myſterie:</hi> one thing is ſeene, another is vnderſtood: that which is ſeene hath a bodily ſhape, that which is <hi>vnderſtood</hi> (hee ſaith not which is <hi>in</hi> or <hi>vnder</hi> the bread) <hi>hath a ſpirituall fruit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yea, that then the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> did not beleeue any ſuch <hi>Reall-preſence,</hi> as after it did, may appeare by theſe Arguments.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That they did not vnderſtand the <hi>Bread</hi> to bee <hi>made</hi> the <hi>very body of Chriſt</hi> by vertue of any words of <hi>conſecration</hi> vſed by the Prieſt; but, by the <hi>ineffable working of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> as <hi>Florus</hi> ſaith. And ſecondly, not the body of Chriſt <hi>in it</hi> ſelfe, but to the <hi>faithfull Receiuer,</hi> to whom the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> doth communicate the true body and blood of Chriſt <hi>ſpiritually,</hi> vnto life. Therefore was the prayer in the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane order</hi> at the <hi>conſecration</hi> (when <note n="a" place="margin">Michrol. de Miſſa rite ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebranda c. <hi>14.</hi>
                  </note> none were preſent, but <hi>Communicaturi</hi> ſuch as were to communicate) <hi>vt oblatio fiat nobis corpus &amp; ſanguis Domini,</hi> that the oblation may bee made to vs the body and blood of the Lord: not, <hi>vt fiat,</hi> ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply that it may bee made, but (<hi>nobis,</hi> to vs) <hi>i. e.</hi> as is after ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, <hi>nobis accipientibus,</hi> to vs the <hi>Receiuers.</hi> They did not then, thinke the <hi>Bread</hi> to bee <hi>made</hi> the <hi>Body of Chriſt,</hi> in it ſelfe; and to <hi>gazers</hi> on but to the <hi>faithfull Receiuers, [Vt effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciatur fidelibus corpus &amp; ſanguis Chriſti,</hi>] that it may be made ſo to beleeuers ſaith <note n="b" place="margin">Florus ibid. quo ſupra.</note>

practiſe. Thirdly, they did not thinke, that which they ſaw to bee the <hi>Species</hi> of <hi>Bread and Wine</hi>; and to haue vnder that <hi>ſhew,</hi> the <hi>body of Chriſt</hi>; but that which they ſaw, to be the <hi>body of Chriſt, i.e.</hi> In a <hi>myſterie,</hi>

                  <hi>Cuius corpus ibi confringi videmus &amp; credimus,</hi> whoſe body wee ſee and beleeue to be there broken ſaith <hi>Micrologus.</hi> So it was the body of Chriſt as they <hi>ſaw</hi> it, and ſaw it <hi>broken,</hi> which could not bee ſaid of his <hi>naturall</hi> body, but onely of the <hi>myſterie</hi> or <hi>Sacrament</hi> of his body.</p>
               <p n="4">4. They did not beleeue whole Chriſt to bee in either <hi>Species,</hi> as muſt needs haue beene beleeued, if they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited that his very naturall body had beene <hi>in,</hi> or <hi>with</hi> the Bread or Cup, or <hi>exiſtent</hi> vnder the <hi>ſhewes</hi> of them: For <hi>Florus</hi> expreſly ſaith, <hi>wee receiue him in the Sacrament per partes</hi> by parts.

before. The preſent Roman Miſſall obſerveth the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of <hi>putting a parcell of the Hoaſt</hi> into the Cup, at that time of [<hi>Pax tecum:</hi>] but hath, without any great ſhew of change, altered the words, and to another meaning.

               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, that the Romane Church did not then beleeue any <hi>Reall preſence</hi> of Chriſt, as brought <hi>vnder</hi> the <hi>Species,</hi> by the Prieſts, and formall words of <hi>Conſecration,</hi> appeareth by this, that when the Biſhop did <hi>conſecrate,</hi> there was but one Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, or cup of wine before him: of which a little was after powred into other veſſels of wine, to conſecrate that for the Communicants, <hi>Quia vinum etiam non conſecratum ſed ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine Domini commixtum ſanctificatur per omnem modum,</hi> becauſe the Wine that yet was not conſecrated, but onely mixed with the Blood of our Lord, is ſanctified by euery way by them vſed: whereas now, the Conſecration is li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited to certaine formall words, and to onely ſo much as the Prieſt <hi>intendeth</hi> to conſecrate; becauſe forſooth, no more can be made the Body or Blood of Chriſt then is at that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, turned thereunto. Wherefore I now aſſume as mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, that the Romane Church was not as yet, nor before the 900 yeere of our Lord, poſſeſſed of the dotages either of <hi>Conſubſtantiation,</hi> or <hi>Tranſubſtantiation.</hi> And yet euen then obſerued, vpon the <hi>Station</hi> dayes, when they might not <hi>kneele</hi> in <hi>publike prayer,</hi> yet at the <hi>Celebration of the Sacramens</hi> to <hi>bow downe</hi> themſelues in thoſe prayers (wherein they might not <hi>kneele)</hi> in token of their <hi>humble and reuerend ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of the ſpeciall grace of God, ſigned, ſealed and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited to them thereby.</hi> And, that they likewiſe had care, in the <hi>act of receiuing,</hi> to <hi>diſcerne</hi> the Lords Body <hi>reverentiâ

                  </note>THe laſt Obſeruation is, That on all other dayes, ſaue the Lords dayes and Pentecoſt, they were, by Order, to make all their prayers, <hi>fixis in torram genibus, kneeling</hi> both in <hi>Tertullians</hi> time, and ſo along. Now, if by <hi>Order,</hi> they then prayed <hi>kneeling,</hi> and a <hi>prayer</hi> was made for <hi>each Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicant</hi> at the time of <hi>deliuery</hi>; and he for himſelfe, at the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing</hi> had a <hi>ſhort prayer</hi>; who can perſwade himſelfe, that <hi>they did not on all thoſe dayes receiue it kneeling?</hi> And if it bee, (as <hi>Altare Damaſcenum</hi> ſaith it is) moſt like that they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued it on thoſe dayes; as they did, on the Lords dayes: Then ſay I, that on the <hi>Lords dayes</hi> alſo, they did receiue it <hi>kneeling</hi>; And, on the <hi>weeke dayes</hi> were bound ſo to doe, by that Decree which required them to <hi>kneele in all their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> conſequently. That there is not to bee found any <hi>Decree for the geſture of kneeling in the Act of receiuing,</hi> no not in the <hi>Romane-Church,</hi> before, or after the <hi>Reall preſence,</hi> nor yet in the <hi>Greeke Church</hi> (where yet they vſed to <hi>kneele)</hi> doth manifeſt both the Antiquity and vniuerſality of this Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, which out of a common notion of all Chriſtians (that in partaking of the body and blood of the Sonne of God, it was comely for them to expreſſe, <hi>reuerentiam ſingulariter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitam)</hi> did make it ſelfe a <hi>Law</hi> vnto them, without any <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree,</hi> as out of <hi>Tertullian</hi> I have ſhewed before.</p>
               <p>And therefore, againſt <hi>Altare Damaſc.</hi> I ſay with Maſter <hi>Beza,</hi> that this geſture of <hi>Adoration in receiving,</hi> was in <hi>vſe</hi> and <hi>ſtate</hi> long before the <hi>Reall preſence</hi> was hatched; and was taken vp by the brewers of the Dreame, and pleaded as an Argument for the <hi>Reall preſence,</hi> as if the worſhip inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the perſon of Chriſt ſitting in Heauen, had beene al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes meant to him as <hi>contained in the Bread and Wine,</hi> or

               <p>I therefore conclude, that <hi>Kneeling in the act of receiuing, was not brought into the Church by Antichriſt; nor euer was yet ſtrengthened with any Papall Decree; but hath been made a foot-banke vnto that Antichriſtian monſter of Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> onely by miſ-interpretation of it, by ſuch as ſought out all meanes, and laid hold on any colourable thing, that might ſuckle the monſter of their braine, when it was once borne. <hi>Beza</hi> therefore, and other Churches which liue pell-mell with the Popiſh, where Idolatry is openly in the ſtreetes committed, in <hi>bowing to a piece of Bread,</hi> as if it were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but Chriſt himſelfe ſhifted into a new ſuit of apparell, had reaſon enough to forbeare this geſture in their Churches: and to diſſwade it, as a thing which <hi>had beene,</hi> and therefore <hi>may</hi> bee dangerous.<note place="margin">Beza Epiſt. <hi>12</hi> &amp; adverſus Heſhuſium in Opuſculis pag. <hi>311.</hi> &amp; queſt. &amp; reſponſ.

               <p>And <hi>Dialection Euchariſtiae</hi> printed and publiſhed with the ſecond volume of <hi>Beza</hi> his Workes, and in his life time, at <hi>Geneua, Ann.</hi> 1570. ſaith, <hi>Veteres Euchariſtiam cum ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mareuerentia &amp; magno honore tutos tamen ab Jdololatria fuiſſe, quod nobis etiam, antiquâ diſciplinâ reuocatâ, &amp; catechiſmi for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mâ reſtitutâ, contingeret.</hi> The Ancients receiued the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt with all reuerence and great honour (that is, as hee ſaith on the next page, <hi>adorantes,</hi> adoring it) and yet were free from all Idolatry, which alſo wee might doe, by recalling the ancient diſcipline, and reſtoring the forme of catechiſme.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Bread-worſhip</hi> was brought in by Antichriſt indeed, and was as <hi>Cofter</hi> (though to another purpoſe) ſaith, the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:7305:61"/>
greateſt idolatry that euer was in the world, if the Bread bee not turned into the true and naturall body of Chriſt; as, vpon my ſoule, it is not.</p>
               <p>This Ceremony was not brought in by him, but turned from the Creator by an horrible blindneſſe, to the creature; from which, if wee returne it to the true owners of all <hi>reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Adoration,</hi> ſhall this bee our ſinne, or theirs that will needs condemne vs? I lament to ſee the tranſport of Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſuch as ſay, <hi>the Formaliſts ſeeme to beleeue the Reall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence in the Elements</hi>; which, if it bee true, God will judge vs; if not, hee that accuſeth falſely is guilty of that which he objecteth as a ſlander; and by the law of God, to beare the ſame puniſhment.</p>
               <p>Object. There remaineth the laſt Objection, viz. <hi>That it is not lawfull to kneele before a conſecrated creature</hi>; Ergo, <hi>not to kneele in receiuing the Communion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The <hi>Antecedent</hi> is not ſimply true. The <hi>conſequence</hi> will not hold, if the <hi>Antecedent</hi> were abſolutely true; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the <hi>Argument</hi> failes. The humane nature of Chriſt is a <hi>conſecrated creature,</hi> and yet was it lawfull to bow before it, as the <hi>fleſh of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Arke</hi> of God, the <hi>Temple,</hi> the <hi>Holy Mountaine,</hi> the <hi>Altar</hi> of God, were meere creatures <hi>conſecrated</hi> of God. So was the <hi>Buſh, Cloud,</hi> the <hi>fire</hi> which came from heauen, for that preſent vſe of them: yet the people of God (as hath beene ſaid) <hi>bowed before them,</hi> worſhipping not the <hi>creature,</hi> but the <hi>Creator</hi>; and that they did this lawfully (though it was not to <hi>commanded</hi> of God) wee haue heard out of <hi>Alta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re Damaſcenum,</hi> and are well aſſured, out of the Scriptures, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 99.6.8. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The termes therefore of <hi>bowing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> muſt bee ſtated in ſome certaine meaning to make the <hi>Antecedent</hi> true.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Bowing before,</hi> is ſometimes, onely <hi>bowing downe,</hi> when a thing is before vs and is <hi>in ſenſu diuiſo,</hi> in a diuided ſenſe; when the bowing hath no <hi>intendment</hi> to that thing which is before vs. And thus, when euer wee bow downe, wee muſt needs bow before ſome creature; <hi>conſecrated,</hi> or <hi>not,</hi> maketh no difference in this Notion.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="114" facs="tcp:7305:62"/>2. <hi>Bowing before a creature,</hi> is <hi>in ſenſu conjuncto,</hi> in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunctiue ſenſe; and is twofold, firſt when the creature is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected only as <hi>obiectum a quo,</hi> the object from which, not <hi>ad quod</hi> to which we take occaſion to bow, by occaſion wherof wee bow our ſelues not at all to the conſecrated creature, but vnto God who hath ſanctified the creature to bee a <hi>ſigne of his preſence,</hi> or <hi>ſpeciall grace,</hi> of which ſort are the inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces giuen, and this is alſo lawfull.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Bowing before,</hi> is alſo ſometimes bowing to the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>i.e.</hi> to <hi>determine</hi> the Adoration in the creature, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for it owne ſake, or in Relation to ſomething elſe, as the Papiſts moſtly profeſſe their bowing to bee done to their Images of Chriſt, &amp;c. And to the very <hi>Species</hi> of bread and wine, as vnited or conjoyned to the perſon of Chriſt.<note place="margin">Minutius Fae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tix in Oct. apud Arnobium.</note> And thus to bow to any conſecrated creature, or <hi>before</hi> it, is Idolatry; and ſo it is, to <hi>bare the head,</hi> or <hi>kiſſe the hand,</hi> as the old Idolaters did when the Image of <hi>Serapis</hi> paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by them. He that ſhall charge this Church ſo to <hi>bow</hi> to the <hi>conſecrated creature,</hi> either for it ſelfe, or for Chriſts ſake, ſhall apparantly ſlander it. See before the Churches publike <hi>Declaration.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But ſuppoſe it were vnlawfull to <hi>bow before a conſecrated Creature,</hi> reſpectiuely to it as an <hi>occaſionall object</hi> onely: and ſo make the <hi>Antecedent</hi> thus; <hi>It is vnlawfull to bow downe to God before any Conſecrated creature, reſpectiuely as an obiect, from whence wee take occaſion to bow:</hi> yet will not the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence</hi> hold, that therefore it is <hi>vnlawfull to receiue the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament kneeling.</hi> For it is not <hi>ordayned,</hi> nor <hi>vnderſtood</hi> in this Church, that the <hi>Kneeling</hi> hath any reſpect vnto the Conſecrated Creature, ſo much as <hi>Obiectum à quo,</hi> but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hath a reſpect vnto the Declaration of our humble ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging the benefits internally communicated to the worthy Receiuer. And therefore there is no ſhew of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doration</hi> made before the Conſecrated creatures, when they ſtand on the Table before vs, or at any time elſe; but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we <hi>kneele</hi> in the <hi>act of receiuing</hi> them. Nor doth the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter come alwayes <hi>before,</hi> but more vſually on the <hi>one ſide</hi> of the Communicants diſpoſed in their Seats. The <hi>Signes</hi>
                  <pb n="115" facs="tcp:7305:62"/>
therefore are but <hi>accidentally</hi> before the Communicants, when they <hi>receiue</hi>; that is, for the reaſon of the <hi>Diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and not of purpoſe brought before them, to take vp any <hi>Adoration</hi> by the ſight of them vnto God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Altare Damaſcenum,</hi> taking it for graunted, that <hi>Wee adore Chriſt before the holy ſignes occaſionally as before obiects à quo,</hi> telleth vs, that this is all one with that Image-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, which ſome of the learned Papiſts, as <hi>Durandus</hi> and <hi>Holcot, &amp;c.</hi> doe allow, who would not haue the <hi>Adoration</hi> at all referred to the <hi>Image,</hi> but to the <hi>Prototype:</hi> And, to maintaine his ſlaunder, is content to ſay, that <hi>their Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges alſo are conſecrated.</hi> Wherein, beſide his miſtaking of our <hi>Kneeling,</hi> hee commits two faults; one, when hee equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocateth in the tearme <hi>Conſecrated,</hi> as it Gods conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that which is meerly of men, were alike. A ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, when he compareth Images of Gods <hi>making</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution,</hi> with Images made by the <hi>luſt of men</hi> againſt Gods <hi>forbidding.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>One man, at the Baptiſme of his Childe, will make a Prince to bee one of his Witneſſes, or as wee ſay, <hi>Goſſips</hi>; and without asking him leaue, hee ſets out a Deputie, and obſerueth him with State in reference to the Prince. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath the Graunt of the Prince of ſuch a fauour, the Prince deſigneth his Deputie to repreſent his Perſon, that Perſon is ſerved in State, as if hee were a Prince, not to honour him, but the Prince whom for that time hee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonates. Are theſe two Caſes alike warrantable, or alike blameable? Such is our Caſe: the Papiſts without leaue make a Crucifixe; and, to the honouring, not of the Crucifixe, but of Chriſt crucified, doe ſuite and ſeruice thereto, or <hi>before</hi> it <hi>reſpectiuely</hi> to it as a type: wee haue the <hi>Image</hi> of Chriſt crucified in the <hi>Supper,</hi> by his owne appointment, wee doe our homage before them, not as Creatures, but as his <hi>deputies, Sacraments</hi>; nor, at all to them as they are Creatures, but by occaſion of them, or by them to Chriſt whoſe they are. Is this all one? This I ſpeake <hi>ex Hypotheſi,</hi> ſuppoſing, not graunting that wee doe performe any Adoration to them in relation to

               </head>
               <p>ANd thus Sir, to ſatisfie your deſire, I haue too largely Anſwered to the objected Queſtions propounded in your letter; and almoſt within the time of three weekes which you limited. If you meet with needleſſe repetitions, and find (as is like you may) many defaults, beare with mee. For I haue written this, as <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> was builded, in a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blous time, yea verely in the moſt troublous time (all things conſidered) that euer yet came vpon mee, the very houre of darkneſſe and ſhaddow of death.</p>
               <p>In this time therefore I had cauſe to looke about mee, and to conſider what I had now in hand, which I alſo did. And if in all this time wherein I haue beene ſoaked and laide to ſteepe in ſo much tribulation, I had found any wauering or doubtfulneſſe in my mind about theſe matters, I haue written of, aſſure your ſelfe I ſhould haue deſiſted. But ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding fully perſwaded as in the ſight of the Lord, that I haue the truth with mee, and follow it. I did, as by ſtarts and fits I could,<note place="margin">His private letter contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a requeſts: but becauſe the firſt of the three concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned only ſome private ſad af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires of his own, &amp; of ſom of his neere friends, that is here omitted, as not at all belonging to the matter here debated.</note> proceed, knowing that the line of diuine light ought to ſway our judgements, and not either the ſun-ſhine of peace, or ſhadowes of the euening ſtretched out vpon vs. Yea and in truth I tooke this taske vpon me as a Medicine, to reſtraine (what I could) my troubled ſpirit from conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall feeding vpon that very bitter herbe which had trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled it.</p>
               <p>Now I haue two Requeſts vnto you, one for the <hi>Church of God</hi>; the other for <hi>my ſelfe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the <hi>Church of God,</hi> I beſeech you by our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, that if you thinke as I doe, that the Ceremonies in Queſtion, howeuer they may ſeeme to vs <hi>Inconuenient</hi> in ſome reſpects; yet, are not <hi>vnlawfull,</hi> but ſuch as men (not impriſoned with prejudice) may with good conſciences ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue,

as matters of externall Order, impoſed on vs by law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full authority. Then ſir, doe your beſt endeauour to hold thoſe that ſtand wauering vnto their colours. And doe not yet make ſo much way to any euill affected, or open enemies to our Religion, nor weaken our party againſt the common Aduerſaries of our faith by diſunion of themſelues. Let not, for theſe things in which the kingdome of God ſtandeth not, thoſe things in which it doth ſtand, bee abandoned. Let no man build vpon his former perſwaſion, which can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe no longer then till it bee better informed. Let no man walke after the Tradition of men, though good and learned. Nay let them conſider that of graue and holy <hi>Zanchy,</hi>

of our Gouernours, the ſtopping of our mouthes, the deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation (for ought wee know) of our flockes, the diſtreſſe of our families, and withall (which is not the leaſt) the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of an errour (by our if not <hi>doctrine,</hi> yet <hi>example</hi>) in the hearts of all thoſe, who are, or ſhall bee led to condemne as vntolerable, that which God will juſtifie as <hi>lawfull</hi> in vs; and ſo doth, as I am fully perſwaded, by his Word.</p>
               <p>Touching <hi>my ſelfe,</hi> I haue theſe requeſts to you; that you would remit this tract vnto meet againe, without giuing any copy of it, that I may (which I now could not) reuiſe, and amend it. And let me haue your free judgement of it; and if you take mee to bee deciued, ſet vp ſome cleere light before mee, and pray that mine eyes may bee opened. And I ſhall giue glory to God, who knoweth the vprightneſſe of my heart in this matter.</p>
               <p>For the reſt, commend mee to my friends, more ſpecially to my &amp;c. Let mee yet, of the little patch of life remaining, haue ſome releefe of comfort in your loue continued. And aboue all, pray for mee that the Lord who chaſtiſeth, would keepe me in his loue, burne out the droſſe that is in mee, ſanctifie mee wholly to himſelfe, and the ſeruice of his Church, and keepe mee (as I hope hee will) faſt knit vnto himſelfe in Chriſt, and when the time commeth; yea, and till then, vouchſafe to honour his owne name in my life and death. <hi>Farewell.</hi>
